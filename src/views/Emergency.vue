      <h1>Suicide prevention</h1>
      <p>
        It’s our instinct to want to help our loved ones through things, and
        being a part of their support system is incredibly important, but it
        needs to be recognized that there are qualified, trained people who
        should help handle these matters. There are mental health professionals
        who have extensive training in how to deal with this, and they should be
        the first line of people to deal with this. While it is vital to
        understand how you can help with suicide prevention, remember that it is
        not necessary for you to become the primary caregiver in this
        situation.<br />
